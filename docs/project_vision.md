# Project Vision

A command line version of the Go Fish Card game that implements all of the rules of Go Fish.

Go Fish is quite a simple card game and may look a lot like luck. However, because it is so simple there
are actually some straightforward strategies that can be used to maximise your chances of winning. By
following these strategies, it should be possible to make computer players that are very hard for a human
to beat.

Oh, and it should look nice.
